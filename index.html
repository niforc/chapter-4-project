<h1>Nicholas Forcum</h1>
<p>One of my favorite things to do is deer firearms season. I also enjoy video games.
	I enjoy spending time with my family, whether that is watching a movie or playing 
	a board game. During the summer months I spend a lot of time at the Lake of the
	Ozarks. Fishing, swimming and boating are all pastimes then.</p>
